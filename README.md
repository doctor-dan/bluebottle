Item Management System (IMS) to manage items sold at Blue
Bottle Coffee caf√©s.

Description:

* Rails API back-end
* React front end

The system allows you to update the price of an individual item, 
and globally change all items in a specific category. In addition,
there is an option to reload all the pricing information from the original files.

Background:

In approaching this design I considered two architectures:
1. Load a database from the external source files and modify the pricing in that database
2. External files are source of truth. Database contains a set of changes or patches to be 
applied for price changing.

I went with the first choice as it seemed the most straight forward.

Production Readiness

* App is deployed to Heruko, https://sheltered-atoll-65206.herokuapp.com/
    with a postgreSql database running a Puma server. The front and and back end are deployed from a single location.

What's Left TODO
* Autoload data on app startup.  Currently, if you are running locally, you need to run rails, create the database and then
load in the schema. There are no migrations on the rails side. Once the app is running, you can press the "Reset all Prices" button to 
load in the initial data.
* Testing React. While the rails server has a good set of spec tests, there are currently no tests
in place for the react side. I setup mocha, chai and jsdom, but did not have time to write any user tests
* Better design. I may be able to create a react app but don't expect me to style it. Not my strong suit.
* Menu table sorting.  I used a simple table to display a menu by country. I did not implement any sorting by columns.
